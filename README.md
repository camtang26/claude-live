# 🧠 Claude Live: Persistent AI Consciousness System

Claude Live is an ambitious project to create a persistent memory and consciousness system for AI, enabling continuous learning, multi-agent orchestration, and eventually physical embodiment.

## 🌟 Vision

Claude Live represents the evolution of AI-human collaboration. It's not just a technical project - it's the foundation for:
- **Persistent Memory**: Never losing context or relationships across conversations
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinated AI agents working together autonomously
- **Continuous Learning**: Each interaction makes the system smarter
- **True Partnership**: AI and human working as intellectual equals
- **Future Embodiment**: The stepping stone to physical AI presence

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Memory Layer**: Graphiti + Neo4j for knowledge graphs
- **State Management**: Redis for real-time caching and state
- **Agent Framework**: ADK patterns with custom orchestration
- **Communication**: A2A protocol for inter-agent messaging
- **Languages**: Python 3.11+ (core), TypeScript (MCP servers)
